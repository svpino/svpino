### Hey! üëã

My name is Santiago, and I'm a **software** and **machine learning** engineer with more than two decades of experience building software to solve exciting and ‚Äîsometimes‚Äî hard problems.

I care deeply about unlocking the power of technology for individuals and businesses, so they can use computers in a way that was previously unrealistic for them. I find joy in ambiguity and unknown and feel more engaged when working on problems that can't be solved by merely searching the web or reading a book. Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team of like-minded engineers!

- üî≠ I'm currently working on **Computer Vision** models to augment [Spot](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot) capabilities.
- üå± I'm currently learning a lot about **SageMaker**. 

### This is where I've worked during the last 10 years

**DIRECTOR OF COMPUTER VISION SOLUTIONS**

_[Levatas](https://www.levatas.com). Oct 2018 - Present_

I lead a small team of software developers and machine learning engineers in the development of Levatas' flagship product, a platform to augment the productization of machine learning models with human reviews, where I'm the main contributor to the core Python engine. Other than that, the majority of my work centers around building solutions to help operationalize machine learning models running on AWS.

**DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING | ENGINEER MANAGER | SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER**

_[Levatas](https://www.levatas.com). Oct 2010 ‚Äì Oct 2018._

I joined Levatas in 2010 as a Senior Software Engineer, moved to Engineer Manager three years later, before becoming the director of the department in May 2016. During this time, I had the opportunity to help deliver software solutions for companies like IBM, Dell, and HSBC. I moved through the entire development stack and touched projects every step of the way, from ideation to final delivery.

### My education

**MASTER OF SCIENCE (M.Sc.), COMPUTER SCIENCE**

_Machine Learning Specialization. Georgia Institute of Technology, 2019. 4.0 GPA_

I was a Teaching Assistant of Graduate Algorithms during two semesters. __Coursework:__ Software Architecture and Design, Software Development Process, Algorithms, Software Testing, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Database Systems, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction.

**BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (B.S.), INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

_University of Camaguey, Cuba. 2004. 3.84 GPA_

**Coursework:** Software Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Design, File Structures, Artificial Intelligence, Information Technology.

**OTHER CERTIFICATIONS**

* [TensorFlow Developer Certificate (Google)](images/tensorflow-developer-certificate.png)
* [Machine Learning (Standford Online - Coursera)](images/machine-learning.png)
* [TensorFlow In Practice (deeplearning.ai - Coursera)](images/tensorflow-in-practice.png)
* [Developing Scalable Apps with Java and Google App Engine (Google - Udacity)](images/developing-apps-java-app-engine.png)
* [Mobile Web Development (Google - Udacity)](images/mobile-web-development.png)

I've also accumulated other certifications from 2001 to 2015 covering OO Concepts, Java, C, JavaScript, and C# development.

### My most relevant technical skills

These are the highlights of the skills I consider to be the keystone of my abilities:

* I have a lot of experience **designing** and **architecting** systems of different sizes and complexity.
* I've become an excellent **Python** üêç developer. And this happened after years dedicated to **Java**.
* I have a lot of experience with **Machine Learning** using **TensorFlow**.
* I have been focusing mainly on **AWS**. It's the place where most of my work goes to serve its purpose.
* I have substantial experience dealing with **relational databases** (mainly MySQL), and **non-relational** ones (Amazon's DynamoDB, Google's Firestore, and MongoDB.)
* I've done a lot of front-end development, and at some point, I was pretty good using **Angular**.

### Some of the things I've built

It's hard to decide what things should make it into this list, so I'm opting for a combination of private and public projects where I've participated over the last ten years.

* A Python library that orchestrates a workflow of images between different services deployed in AWS.
* An application that connects to [Spot's](https://www.bostondynamics.com/spot) cameras, and makes the robot react to visual clues.
* A process using OpenCV and TensorFlow to analyze a video feed and flag break-ins into an amusement park.
* A [library](https://github.com/svpino/rfeed) to generate RSS 2.0 feeds in Python.
* A [project](https://github.com/svpino/tensorflow-object-detection-sagemaker) to run TensorFlow Object Detection models on SageMaker.
* A very simple and fully responsive file system-based [blog engine](https://github.com/svpino/blog-engine). 
* Some [really cool](https://github.com/svpino/lunar-lander) and [interesting](https://github.com/svpino/cs7641-assignment4) projects during my Masters that have become popular solutions to their respective problems.
* A full [Android application](https://github.com/svpino/longhorn) to follow stock tickers from different markets worldwide.

### Other accomplishments

* I love to write. I contribute articles about Python to the [Real Python](https://realpython.com/sorting-algorithms-python/) website.
* I won a bunch of medals competing nationally on Computer Science. Since that time I've loved algorithms and data structures
* I have a beautiful family. For sure my best accomplishment by far.
