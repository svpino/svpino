### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Santiago, and I'm **software** and **machine learning engineer** with more than two decades of experience building software to solve interesting and â€”sometimesâ€” hard problems.

I'm obsessed with providing incremental value, shipping early, speed, and quality. I find joy in ambiguity and unknown, and love to work on problems that you can't solve by simply searching the web or reading a book.


You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/svpino), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svpino/), or my [personal blog](https://blog.svpino.com).
