### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Santiago, and I have a passion for solving **hard problems**. Things that you can't find by searching the web or reading a book. Things that stretch me to enormous lengths and make me extraordinarily uncomfortable.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/svpino), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svpino/), or my [personal blog](https://blog.svpino.com).
